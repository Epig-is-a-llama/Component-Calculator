To create your own database you will need to produce a .txt file with the contents of what you want to go in the database in the form: (Please note that words in `` are variables the user must correctly configure).
Entry-`Product one`
`Units produced`
`Ingredient one`
`Units of ingredient one`
End of entry
Please note you can have as many ingredients as you like for each product.
Once the file is done and you are happy with it copy it into the 'un-complied_databases' folder in this folder and then select the `Database Build.cmd` and run it.
Doing so will open a command line window asking you a series of questions which should be self explanatory.
Once that is done you can then find both a .zip version of your database and a .exe installer for it which can be distributed or published to the repository following the steps found on the wiki there for doing so.
